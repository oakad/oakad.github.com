Access rights management: slower means better
#############################################

   Proper management of resource access rights in computer systems is one of the
   most complicated and, one might say, convoluted problems of computer system
   design. Even more so, access rights are too often managed by means of badly
   designed protocols, which are prone to abuse. However, proper design of
   rights management protocol is impossible without an appropriate analysis of
   protocol entities involved. In fact, root causes of security failures
   experienced by rights management systems can easily be attributed to
   incorrect identification of foundational entities of those systems.

Treatise on copyright and preservation of information
#####################################################

It is quite common, in recent times, to discuss problems arising from
application of copyright in the modern digital environment. However, the
real problem, which is commonly missed, is the obvious lack of duty, which,
necessarily, must be associated with any social right.

The aspect of duty is missed not only in context of copyright discussions.
Indeed, in our overabundant society duties are sometimes forgotten outright.
Yet, they exist and every right has an associated duty, and without such a
balance truly just society cannot exist.

The concept above is obvious to the level of triviality when we talk about
"natural" human rights. Since the long forgotten days of king Hammurabi it
is accepted, that person, who denies his fellow human of the right to own
his property or even of his life must be punished, possible by the same
measure. So, the right to live is mandated by the duty to let live everybody
else. I won't go into the philosophical abyss it is the discussion of basic
human rights and limit myself to accepted practises of property laws. After
all, most eager proponents of copyright law tightening prefer to treat
copyrighted items like imaginary property.

The basic duty associated with the right to own property is taxation. It is
important to point out that taxation is not some sort of punishment, inflicted
by the state on its citizens. On a contrary, taxes, at least in theory, serve
as important regulator, aiming to maximise the common good at the small expense
of the private discomfort. Simplest example of the kind is dependency of public
road construction funding on fuel tax. If people are willing to spend more on
fuel, State gets more money to build and maintain roads. On a contrary, when
demand for fuel is low, State can reduce its road maintenance efforts, as they
are not really required, and, consequentially, earns less of the fuel tax
money. This is more or less how social justice is intended to work - in a form
of negative feedback dynamic regulator, allocating resources to where they are
really needed.

Of particular interest in the context of imaginary property are issues
of real estate ownership and taxation. For generations, since times immemorial
(in fact, since first tetrapod set foot on the land, as many animals also have
concept of owned territory hardwired into their brains) land was the most
valuable resource people could own. And, in fact, we see that ownership of land
is subject to a considerable number of regulations, most of them existing to
minimise the number of conflicts in the community of neighbours. Landlord can
not perform arbitrary activities with his land without asking permission from
the community, and, more important, the property must be kept in order up to
an acceptable standard, also mandated by the same community. Moreover yet,
landlord is obligated to upheld the right to own the property regularly, by
paying an appropriate tax. Failure to do any of this inevitably results in
legal action and forceful transfer of ownership to other, better suited people.

I suppose, at this point of the essay, anybody will understand where I'm going
to. Yes, I say, if copyrighted work is to be considered a property, let it be
real estate, because the field of human mental enterprise and its fruit is much
closer to a real, dirt covered field than to a discardable pair of socks. I
will return to this aspect further down the text, but in the meantime, I shall
address the issue of duty, associated with the (copy)right.
